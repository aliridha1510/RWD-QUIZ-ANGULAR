                If you're hoping for a collection of tricks and tips for adding a little bit of superficial flair to the websites that you build, then keep looking, my friend. This little beauty operates at a deeper level. When you've finished reading this book (and
                that won't take very long) take note of how you approach your next project. It's possible that you won't even notice the mind-altering powers of Ethan's words, delivered, as they are, in his light-hearted, entertaining, sometimes downright
                hilarious style; but I guarantee that your work will benefit from the prestidigitation he is about to perform on your neural pathways.. </h6> <br/><br/>
